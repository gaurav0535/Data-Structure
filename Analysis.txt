Task0
For task 0 worst case. complexity will remain constent

Task 1 
There are two for loops so the worst case will remain 2n equivalent to n

Task 2 
There is only now for loop so its complexity will remain n

Task 3
No nested for loop but we are running twice so complexity will be 2n and will remain n

Task 4
No nested for loop but we are running it 4 times so complexity will be 4n and will remain n



Note --> I am using extra space multiple times
